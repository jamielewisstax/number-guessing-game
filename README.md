# Number guessing game

The computer will think of a number. Can you guess which number it is?

## Project description
The user is asked which difficulty level they want to play at. Easy will give the user 10 lives, hard only 5.
The computer will start thinking of a random number. The user can guess a number, and the computer will tell them if that number is too high or too low.
When the user guesses correctly or they run out of lives, the program ends.
